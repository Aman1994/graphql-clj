## Installation

Add the following dependency to your project.clj file:

    [graphql-clj "0.1.5.-SNAPSHOT"]

## Usage

### Define schema

    (require '[graphql-clj.parser :as parser])
    (require '[graphql-clj.type :as type])

    (def parsed-schema (parser/parse "type User {
        name: String
        age: Int
      }
      type QueryRoot {
        user: User
      }

      schema {
        query: QueryRoot
      }"))

    (def transformed-schema (parser/transform parsed-schema))

    (def type-schema (type/create-schema transformed-schema))

### Define resolver functions

    (require '[graphql-clj.resolver :as resolver])

    (defn customized-resolver-fn [type-name field-name]
      (cond
        (and (= "QueryRoot" type-name) (= "user" field-name)) (fn [context parent & args]
                                                                {:name "test user name"
                                                                 :age 30})))

    (def resolver-fn (resolver/create-resolver-fn type-schema customized-resolver-fn))

### Execute query

    (require '[graphql-clj.executor :as executor])
    (def query-document (parser/transform (parser/parse "query {user {name age}}")))
    (def context nil)
    
    (executor/execute context type-schema resolver-fn query-document)

    ;; {:data {"user" {"name" "test user name", "age" 30}}}
